## Instructions
Design and create a game for the gaming competition 'Games Fleadh'.

# Description of the assignment
The game we designed had to follow the theme the competition had specified.
This year, the theme was "Maze Game". As we worked independently, we used
GitHub to work interdependently. Any ideas were efficiently shared, attempted,
executed, or terminated.

# How it works
The game is entirely designed in C#, using Unity's game engine. The game
is created in 2D, with certain elements being displayed in a 3D perspective,
thus to create a sense of depth and substance. We didn't want the play-style
to be overly simple so this served as a perfect way to prevent that.
The player navigates through a series of mazes, fighting multiple enemies
along the way. The goal is simple: Escape the mazes in as fast a time as possible,
killing as many enemies that stand in your way. The game has a points system that
puts the player's speed out of the maze, and kill count into consideration.
The aim is to achieve the highest score possible. The maze is dimly lit, with a lack of clear
direction due to the darkness that envelopes the landscape. The player can drop
little light fixtures along their way in order to light their path. However,
each light fixture dropped comes at a cost of the player's points, so one must be
strategic and creative in order to make it out of the maze as fast as possible,
with as many points as possible.

# Roles accomplshed by every team member
Daniel Krasovski: Created the scoring system, added the lighting and light drop, added the automatic saving / loading, main menu buttons.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
As a group, we are incredibly proud of how well we were able to work together
to get a common goal achieved. We didn't ever expect our game to be chosen
for Games Fleadh, and we are incredibly grateful for the opportunity we were given.
This assignment has shown us how powerful interdependence can be, and the power of synergy
in a workplace.
